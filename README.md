# Introduction

![goto](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/goto.png)

<br />

## Purpose

At PumpUp, we hold high standards for the quality of code that powers any of our products. Maintaining a healthy codebase is **crucial** for large-scale applications to be able to move fast and iterate often.

So, we are creating this guide – an ever-evolving story of how we operate, from avoiding semicolons to shipping.

<br />

## Organization

Each listing in the directory above is a chapter on different aspects of writing code.

Within each chapter is a `README.md` file that talks about a concept with some generic examples.

Along with each chapter’s `README.md` file, there may also be a language specific file, such as `JavaScript.md`, `Swift.md`, and `Java.md`, that goes in depth of how that concept relates to the language.

<br />

## Improvements

At any point in your development, if you learn something new, please document it! This is a continuous work in progress and is only as good as we make it.

If you're unsure as to whether or not your changes are appropriate, open a [PR](Pull Requests).

<br />

## Thanks for reading!

Made with :heart: by your fellow teammates at [PumpUp](http://pumpup.com).
